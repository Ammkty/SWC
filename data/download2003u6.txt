TI Physical properties of a south Brazilian Oxisol as affected by no-tillage and conventional tillage systems

DE soil management systems; soil quality; crop productivity; sustainability
AB Soil management affects the soil physical quality, but the magnitude of the changes is dependent of use time and regional edaphoclimatic conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term (21 yr) effect of conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems on some physical properties in the 0.2 m top layer of an Oxisol from Parana, southern Brazil. In comparison with an adjacent forest soil used as reference, the use of CT system increased the soil bulk density, penetrometer resistance and soil temperature; and decreased the mean geometric diameter of soil aggregates The main changes in soil attributes by using NT in comparison with CT were: decrease in soil bulk density in subsurface layer (0.1 - 0.2 m) from 1.08 to 0.99 Mg m(-3); decrease in maximum soil temperature in the 0-0.05 m layer from 27.9 to 24.7 degreesC, increase in mean geometric diameter of soil aggregates from 1.6 to 3.7 mm at 0-0.05 m layer, and increase in volumetric soil water content in the 0-0.1 m layer from 0.38 to 0.48 m(3) m(-3). However, there were no differences between effects of tillage systems on soil porosity (total, macro and microporosity), saturated hydraulic conductivity, penetrometer resistance, and clay flocculation degree. The amelioration of physical properties in no-tilled soil may be related to increases of 42% in soybean and 22% in corn yields in this conservation tillage system, in comparison with CT system.

AB Pygmyflower is becoming increasingly abundant in conservation-tillage cropping systems of the Canadian Prairies. Increased knowledge of pygmyflower biology would facilitate development of integrated programs for its control. A controlled environment study was conducted to determine the combined effect of various soil temperature and soil water levels on pygmyflower emergence. Pygmyflower emerged at soil temperatures ranging from 10 to 25 C with optimal emergence at 15 C. Emergence was inhibited completely at 5 or 30 C. Pygmyflower emergence markedly declined as soil water content decreased. At progressively lower soil water levels of - 0.03, - 0.28, - 0.53, - 0.78, - 1.03, and - 1.53 MPa, pygmyflower emergence at 15 C was 71, 50, 49, 29, 24, and 15%, respectively. The interaction of warm and dry soils caused the greatest inhibition of pygmyflower emergence. Rate of pygmyflower emergence was reduced greatly by either lowering soil temperature or reducing soil water content. A decrease in soil temperature from 25 to 10 C increased the time to reach 50% emergence (ET50) by 9 to 14 d, whereas a decrease in soil water content from - 0.03 to - 1.53 MPa increased ET50 by 7 to 16 d. Results suggest that pygmyflower may pose the greatest problem in winter crops or early-planted spring crops. Information gained in this study will contribute to the development of an improved pygmyflower management program in annual cropping systems.

AB A long-term experiment was established in 1982 at the Mallee Research Station, Walpeup, Vic., Australia, to investigate the impact of different farming practices in this semi-arid region on the growth and yield of wheat, and the water balance of the soil/ crop system. Two fallow management systems (a zero-tilled fallow with direct drilling and a traditional cultivated fallow without direct drilling) within three rotation systems (fallow-wheat (FW), pasture-wheat (PW) and pasture-fallow-wheat (PFW)) were evaluated in the study. Phosphorus was applied to each wheat crop but no nitrogen fertilisers were used. Simulation analysis was used to compare model performance against 16 years of observed data. Over the course of the experiment grain yields ranged from 0.44 to 3.90 Mg ha(-1). Rotation had the greatest effect on yield with the long fallow (PFW) treatment averaging 0.46 Mg ha(-1) more yield compared with the short fallow (PW). Whilst this yield increase was accompanied by an extra 11-33 mm (mean 16 mm) of pre-sowing root zone soil water in 9 of the 16 years, any causal relationship was at best limited. More important was the marked interaction of seasonal conditions and yield with the FW, and to a lesser extent the PW, suffering yield losses not evident in the PFW rotation in years of high yield potential; a result largely attributed to differences in mineral nitrogen. Conventionally tilled and zero-tilled fallow were similar in grain yield, stored soil water, water use and water use efficiency. As with the rotation treatments, there was a strong interaction of seasonal conditions and tillage response with the zero-tilled system reporting consistently lower yields than the conventional system in all but the very low and high yield potential seasons. The simulation analysis showed similar rotational and seasonal effects on yield (R-2 = 0.47, RMSE = 0.78 Mg ha(-1)) and water use (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 60 mm). However, the model overestimated water use at low yield and predicted higher yields in response to zero tillage over the 16-year period in contrast to the measured data. Whilst further attention to the model in this respect is needed the use of this model in similar environments should not be minimised because the problem is not large. New experiments that look critically at the evaporation reduction from stubble residues on light textured soils are needed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The predominate crops grown in the northern Great Plains of the United States are cereal grains, which are well adapted to the region's semiarid climate and short growing season. However, rotations are changing because minimum- and no-till production systems improve precipitation-use-efficiency. Therefore, producers are seeking diversity in crop choices to improve the design of their rotations. Our objective with this study was to examine water relations and agronomic performance of seven broadleaf crops that may be suitable for a semiarid climate. Dry pea (Pisum sativum L.), dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) were the most favorable for this region considering crop yield and water-use-efficiency (WUE). Soybean (Glycine max L.), crambe (Crambe abyssinica Hochst), canola (Brassica rapa L.), and safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) were less successful. Water use for grain production ranged from 23 to 37 cm among crops whereas water-use-efficiency varied three-fold. Soil water extraction patterns differed between sunflower and dry pea, with sunflower extracting more water as well as accessing water deeper in the soil profile. Integrating oilseed and legume crops with cereal grains in a cycle-of-four rotation will aid producers in managing diseases and weeds, as well as improve grain yield due to the rotation effect.

AB Understanding the fate of soil water and nitrogen (N) is essential for improving crop yield and optimizing the management of water and N in dryland cropping systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate how conventional (CT) and no-till (NT) cropping systems affect soil water and N dynamics. Soil water and N were monitored in 30 cm increments to a depth of 1.5 m for 2 years at growers' fields in two different agroclimatic zones of Washington State (USA): (1) the annual cropping region with a mean annual precipitation of more than 500 rum (Palouse site) and (2) the grain-fallow cropping region with mean precipitation below 350 mm (Touchet site). In each zone, a CT and a NT cropping system were chosen. All sites had an annual cropping system, except for the CT site in the drier area, which was under a traditional winter wheat/fallow rotation previous to the study. At Palouse, the volumetric water content in the top 1.5 m of the soil throughout the year was about 0.05-0.1 m(3) m(-3) less under CT as compared to NT, indicating improved seasonal accumulation and distribution of soil water under NT. Cropping systems modeling indicated, that during winter, surface runoff occurred in the CT system, but not under NT. The differences in soil water dynamics between CT and NT were mainly caused by differences in surface residues. Dynamics of NO3--N at Palouse were similar for NT and CT. At Touchet, differences in soil moisture between NT and CT were less than 0.05 m(3) m(-3). Under NT, high levels of NO3--N, up to 92 kg NO3-N ha(-1), were found after harvest below the root zone between 1.5 and 2.5 m, and were attributed to inefficient use or over-application of fertilizer. In both climatic zones, grain yield was positively correlated with evapotranspiration. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Growth, yield and water productivity of barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.) affected by tillage and N fertilization in Mediterranean semiarid, rainfed conditions of Spain

AB In dryland agricultural systems of the Mediterranean area, the amount and variability of the rainfall are the main constraints to crop yield. Soil management through tillage and rational use of N fertilization can improve the performance of crops through improved use of available water and increased use efficiency. Field experiments were carried out at three locations differing in degree of aridity (Guissona, Agramunt and Candasnos) in the Ebro Valley in Northeast Spain during three growing seasons. Yield and water-use efficiency (WUE) of barley, the predominant crop in the area, were examined under three levels of N fertilization (zero, medium and high) and three soil management systems (no tillage (NT), minimum or reduced (MT) and conventional tillage (CT)). Soil water content, total crop dry matter, leaf area, yield and yield components were measured during consecutive crop cycles. In general, both levels of added nitrogen, increased the yield to about 30% above zero nitrogen. Grain number increased with N fertilization and determined the level of yield response. At two locations (Guissona and Agramunt), a positive effect of MTor NT was observed under dry conditions. Yield (up to 60%) and WUE (up to 50%) were reduced by tillage. In the driest location of Candasnos, where a better response to reduced tillage (MT and NT) was expected, the WUEs for grain yield were low for all treatments (between 2.4 and 6.5 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) and the best crop performance was obtained in tilled treatments. Negative effects on yield were caused by the pests Mayetiola mimeuri Mesnil and Tetramesa tritici (Fitch), when stubble residues remained without tillage management. The use of conservation tillage in this specific Northeast area of the Ebro Valley improved the yield of barley and its WUE. Nitrogen fertilization in this area could be reduced to levels lower that those currently used by farmers. This reduction could be greater with increased tillage intensity. No additional N fertilizer was needed when under conservation tillage. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
