AB Winter cereals used as cover crops in corn (Zea mays L.) production physically modify the soil-plant environment. Springtime killing of the cover crops with herbicides leaves surface residues either standing, flat, or a combination of the two at corn planting. This study was conducted to verify how standing rye (Secale cereale L.) residue affected soil temperature, soil water, and corn development compared with flat rye residue in a sandy loam in Harrow, ON, in 1990, 1991, and 1992. In the 3 yr, volumetric soil water content was similar in both treatments, but seed zone daily maximum temperatures were higher under standing than under flat residue. Corn development in standing residue was faster (2 to 3 d) compared with flat residue, except if seed zone maximum temperatures were regularly in the 28 to 32-degrees-C range for both treatments, such as in 1991. During vegetative stages in 1990 and 1992, plants in the standing residue were taller than plants in the flat residue. Most of these height differences were related to differences in development that were related to soil temperature. In 1991, however, which was a hot and dry year, phyllochron values indicate that developmental rates under both treatments were affected by a factor other than temperature, most likely by a lack of soil water. In 2 of 3 yr, when seed zone temperatures were often below the optimal range for corn development, standing rye residue resulted in faster plant development than flat rye residue due to a warmer seed zone. Residue treatments did Dot affect yield.

TI EFFECTS OF RESIDUE-FREE BAND-WIDTH ON SOIL-TEMPERATURE AND WATER-CONTENT

AB In the Northern Corn Belt, corn crop emergence can be delayed due to slow soil warming and drying when residue is present above the seed furrow. This study was conducted to determine the effects of residue-free band width on soil temperature and water content. Residue-free bands of 0, 80, and 320 mm, as well as a 360-mm-wide residue-free furrow, were created in a field plot study. Also, residue-free bands of 0, 80, 160, and 320 mm were created in a controlled environment study. A thermocouple matrix was placed in the soil around the seed zone. Soil temperature was recorded on a hourly basis during the normal crop planting and emergence period. Soil water samples were also periodically taken during the time soil temperature was determined. In the field study, the width of the residue-free band had a significant effect on temperature in the seed zone and less effect on soil water content. Based on accumulated growing degree days, the theoretical time to corn emergence was modeled as a logarithmic function of band width. Initially, the gradient of this relationship was large, which indicated the accumulated growing degree days increased rapidly with increasing band width. But with band widths greater than 300 mm, the curve's slope became relatively flat. In the controlled environment study, soil temperature below residue was substantially less than that below bare soil. A 320-mm band width accumulated sufficient growing degree days for corn to emerge on the same day as a treatment with no residue cover. Residue condition (shredded and nonshredded) and residue density (6000, 8000, and 10 000 kg/ha) had no significant effect on soil temperature. Soil under residue, even at the bare soil/residue interface, was generally higher in soil water than that below the clear soil surface. A residue-free band width in the 200- to 300-mm range would produce sufficient accumulated growing degree days to result in corn crop emergence on the same day as a treatment with no residue cover.

AB The optimum killing time of a rye (Secale cereale) cover crop is an important management decision and can determine the yield of the subsequent soybean (Glycine max) crop. The objective of this research was to study a rye cover/soybean system. Soybeans were grown on sandy (Delhi) and loam (Woodstock) soils (1989/1990) with mulch on the soil surface obtained by killing rye approximately 1 and 2 wk before soybean planting. A conventional tillage treatment was used as a control. Soil water content, soil temperature, rye mulch amount and soybean growth were monitored over the season. Rye mulch amount for the late killing (LK) date was always larger than for the early killing (EK) date. LK decreased soil water content at soybean planting time at Delhi in 1989. The rye mulch produced with the LK increased soil water content early in the soybean growing season in 1990. A substantial decrease in the amount of mulch was observed during the growing season and resulted in little difference between mulch and no mulch soil water and temperature conditions later in the season. Extreme temperatures were more frequent under the bare soil, but these were limited to a small percentage of hours, and did not translate into differences in soybean development rates. Reduced soybean growth observed early in the season in one out of four location-years vanished as the season progressed. Number of seeds per pod and nodule number were increased due to rye mulch, but no difference in soybean yields were observed among treatments.

AB Sodosol soils are at risk of degradation under existing fallow management practices involving tillage. Topsoil erosion exposes horizons with reduced infiltration and low concentrations of plant nutrients. Conservation management systems are needed on these soils to avoid a reversion to low intensity grazing. This paper reports on a 4 year study (1986-1989) of the effects of tillage practices on profile soil water and crop yield in a Sodosol (Typic Natrustalf ) in central Queensland, Australia. The tillage treatments were: zero till fallow (weed control by herbicides), reduced till fallow (chisel plough/scarifier or herbicides) and conventional till fallow (chisel plough/scarifier) in two linked experiments. In the first experiment, wheat was grown in three contour bays (approximately 1 ha), and in the second, wheat was grown in replicated plots (30 m x 6 m) to allow statistical comparisons. Zero till provided consistent advantages in grain yield in all 4 years compared with conventional till. Zero till also outyielded reduced till as well as conventional till in the plot experiment. The average yield increase of 0.5 t ha-1 in zero till compared with conventional till was associated with greater water use and increased water use efficiency. Tillage practice caused only marginal differences in the available water content in the root zone (0-100 cm) at sowing; zero and reduced till contained, on average, an additional 4 and 8 mm, respectively, compared with conventional till. The tillage treatments had no effect on plant available water capacity. Some of the soil water that accumulated during the fallow drained beyond the root zone in all treatments and was not available to the following wheat crop. At the conclusion of the experiment, soil water accumulation in the 100-180 cm soil layer was 86 mm in zero till, 39 mm in reduced till and 40 mm in conventional till. Results indicate that zero till can be a more productive wheat farming practice than conventional mechanical tillage. The increase in water storage below the root zone of the wheat crop shows that there may be benefit in using a deeper-rooting crop or pasture species in rotation with wheat, particularly after zero till fallows.

AB The presence of wheat straw mulch in no-tillage systems can increase corn yields in the central Great Plains, but information is needed on the optimal mulch level and the toxicity of metolachlor on corn growth. Research was conducted to determine the effect or winter wheat straw mulch levels of 0, 1.7, 3.4, 5.1, and 6.8 t ha-1 and metolachlor rates of 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5X-rates on corn growth and yield in a winter wheat-ecofallow-corn-fallow rotation at three locations across Nebraska. Response of corn to different mulch levels and metolachlor rates varied with climate and location. In general, early corn growth was retarded by increasing amounts of mulch due to reduced soil temperatures, but after tasseling corn grew taller under increasing mulch levels because of increased soil moisture. Soil water content, kernel moisture at harvest, stover dry matter, total dry matter, ears per plant, and kernel weight increased with increasing mulch level. Corn grain yield reached a maximum at a mulch level of 5.1 t ha-1. Kernel weight, kernel number, and grain yield increased with higher mulch levels and 0.5 and 1.0X metolachlor rates as weed competition was reduced, but decreased at the 1.5X-rate of metolachlor due to corn injury. Lack of sufficient growing degree-days to compensate for lower soil temperatures or corn injury reduced corn yields at the higher mulch levels and 1.5X-rate of metolachlor in west-central and western Nebraska. From a practical standpoint, a mulch level of 3.4 to 5.1 t ha-1 and a metolachlor rate near the X-rate should increase corn yield (14 to 15%) over unmulched corn in the central Great Plains.
