AB Reducing tillage and optimizing nitrogen fertilization are important strategies for soil and water conservation and sustainability of Mediterranean agricultural systems. These interacting practices can alter soil water and N availability, and thus affect N uptake, water use efficiency and crop yield. Three levels of N fertilization (zero, medium and high) and three tillage intensities (none, minimum and conventional tillage) were evaluated at three locations of the Ebro Valley in northeast Spain with different degrees of aridity and soil types (Guissona, Agramunt and Candasnos). Uptake of N by barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was two to three times greater with N fertilization at locations with the best yield potential. Tillage increased soil mineral N content depending on location. Losses of N ranged from 30 to 80% of applied N each year and were encouraged by high N fertilization rates. Recovery of applied N ranged from 28 to 46.5%. N use efficiency ranged from 13 to 80 kg kg(-1) N and was negatively affected by N fertilization up to 50% and by tillage up to 17%. It is thus found that farmer applications of N fertilizer can be reduced by up to 50%. No-till systems do not require increased amounts of N fertilizer for barley production in these areas. Only in wet years, higher yields are obtained in no till when some N fertilizer is applied. However, in dry years with scarce rainfall during autumn, N should not be applied in any tillage system. Reduced tillage and no till are suitable systems for improving yield and for optimal environmental and economical use of N in these Mediterranean conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Reduced tillage and residue management can have significant impacts on soil and water quality, primarily through the accumulation of soil organic C. Yet, methods of tillage and residue cover assessment are time and resource intensive, and often do not yield spatially representative results. A major goal of this study was to compare new remote sensing (RS) indices with the current line-transect approach for differentiating between conventional (CT) and conservation tillage systems. Experimental plots were located in two physiographic regions in Georgia: the Southern Piedmont and Southern Coastal Plain. Treatments consisted of no tillage (NT) or CT at the Piedmont site, and strip-tillage (ST) or CT at the Coastal Plain site. Remotely sensed data were acquired three times prior to canopy closure, using a handheld multispectral radiometer (485-1650 nm) and thermal imager (7000-14000 nm). Soil texture and soil water content were measured to assess the impact of changes in soil background reflectance on crop residue assessments. Results showed that differences in spectral response between CT and conservation tillage systems were best observed using a normalized difference ratio of near infrared (NIR) (1650 +/- 100 nm) and blue (485 +/- 45 nm) spectra under dry conditions and low canopy cover (< 25%). Differences in soil texture and color were the primary limiting factors in differentiating between tillage treatments. However, using readily available soil survey data, our data indicate that visible and NIR spectra can be used to rapidly differentiate between CT and conservation tillage systems in the Georgia Southeastern Coastal Plain and Piedmont physiographic regions.

AB Increase in the size of dairy cattle farms in northwest Spain has caused an intensification of forage production and reinforced the need for two crops per year However, in this geographical area, the establishment of the winter crop is not always possible because of the high rainfall and the poor workability of the land. The objective of this study is to evaluate the no-tillage system as a possible solution for these workability problems. Although no-till planting systems have been accepted for many years in some regions, it is relatively new to the area where this study was conducted. Cone index (CI) values under two tillage systems were studied during three consecutive growing seasons (200012001, 200112002, and 200212003). The relationship between the penetration resistance and the soil water content of a sandy loam soil was studied during two consecutive growing seasons (200112002 and 200212003). Conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) were compared in a crop of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) in rotation with silage corn (Zea mays L.) during four growing seasons. Soil penetration resistance and soil water content were related to soil workability. The results showed higher cone index values under NT than under CT and a good correlation between penetration resistance and soil water content. NT showed a greater ability to bear traffic load and, therefore, an improvement in soil workability throughout the growing season. This improvement was more valuable in autumn at the time of ryegrass drilling, the critical time from the point of view of soil workability. In spite of the higher CI values, dry matter yields of Italian ryegrass were not significantly different under NT than under CT.

AB Tillage affects the ability of coarse-textured soils of the southeastern USA to sequester C. Our objectives were to compare tillage methods for soil CO2 flux, and determine if chemical or physical properties after 25 years of conventional or conservation tillage correlated with flux rates. Data were collected for several weeks during June and July in 2003, October and November in 2003, and April to July in 2004 from a tillage study established in 1978 on a Norfolk loamy sand (fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kandiudults). Conventional tillage consisted of disking to a depth of approximately 15 cm followed by smoothing with an S-tined harrow equipped with rolling baskets. Conservation tillage consisted of direct seeding into surface residues. Flux rates in conservation tillage averaged 0.84 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in Summer 2003, 0.36 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in Fall 2003, 0.46 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in Spring 2004, and 0.86 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in Summer 2004. Flux rates from conventional tillage were greater for most measurement times. Conversely, water content of the surface soil layer (6.5 cm) was almost always higher with conservation tillage. Soil CO2 flux was highly correlated with soil water content only in conventional tillage. In conservation tillage, no significant correlations occurred between soil CO2 flux and soil N, C, C:N ratio, pH, bulk density, sand fraction, or clay fraction of the surface 7.5 cm. In conventional tillage, sand fraction was positively correlated, while bulk density and clay fraction were negatively correlated with soil CO2 flux rate, but only when the soil was moist. Long-term conservation tillage management resulted in more uniform within- and across-season soil CO2 flux rates that were less affected by precipitation events. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB The use of long fallowing (16-18 months) for soil water conservation has been questioned in semiarid drylands of Central Aragon. We quantify the soil water loss, soil water storage (SWS) and precipitation storage efficiency (PSE) of long fallow under three management systems (conventional tillage; reduced tillage; no-tillage). The precipitation storage efficiency of long fallow relative to short fallow (5-6 months) was also evaluated. Over 4 experimental years (1999-2002), the soil water balance was calculated from fallow seasonal precipitation and volumetric soil water content (>= 10 cm depth). During long fallowing, primary tillage implemented in conventional tillage and reduced tillage plots induced significant soil water losses from the plough layer (0-40 cm depth) for the first 24 h after tillage. However, secondary tillage appeared to have a positive effect on soil water conservation at the end of fallow. The division of long fallow into three sub-periods showed that the early phase (July to November) was the most efficient in terms of soil water storage. Both for the individual fallow phases and the entire fallow period, the precipitation storage efficiency increased when most of the seasonal effective rainfalls (> 10 mm day(-1)) were received in the last 2 months of each period. Long fallow precipitation storage efficiency was low (11% on average). Neither soil water storage nor precipitation storage efficiency was significantly affected by the tillage system. The average additional soil water at sowing after long fallow compared with short fallow was 20 mm.

AB Soil degradation is the single most important threat to global food production and security. Wind and water erosion are the main forms of this degradation, and conservation tillage represents an effective method for controlling this problem. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of three tillage methods [zero (ZT), minimum (MT) and conventional (CT)] and three four-year crop sequences [spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-spring wheat-winter wheat-fallow; spring wheat-spring wheat-flax (Linum usitatissimum L.)-winter wheat; spring wheat-flax-winter wheat-field pea (Pisum sativum L.] on crop establishment, plant height, seed weight, soil water storage, crop water use, crop water use efficiency and grain yield over a 12-year period under Canadian growing conditions. Plant establishment was not adversely affected by tillage systems or crop sequences except for flax, where a small reduction was observed with ZT and MT. Conservation tillage showed a yield benefit over CT of 7%, 12.5% and 7.4% for field pea, flax and spring wheat grown on cereal stubble, respectively over the 12 years of the study. Much of the yield increase was due to an increase in soil water in the 0-30 cm soil layer with ZT and MT. However, tillage systems had no effect on grain yield for spring wheat grown on fallow and field pea stubble due to a lack of differences in spring soil water content. Flax grown in sequence with cereals only yielded higher than when it was grown in the sequence which included field pea, even though flax was seeded on spring wheat stubble in both cases. Winter wheat yielded higher when grown on flax stubble than on spring wheat stubble. The results indicate that a one-year non-cereal break crop was enough to alleviate the negative effects of consecutive cereal crops on winter wheat. Spring wheat grown on field pea stubble always yielded more than when grown on cereal stubble. A 10% increase in water use efficiency was observed with flax grown with ZT and MT management. Crop sequence improved water use efficiency in flax and spring wheat. Growing spring wheat on field pea stubble as opposed to growing it on cereal stubble resulted in a 10% increase in water use efficiency. Overall, rainfall accounted for 73%, 72%, 67% and 65% of total water used by field pea, flax, winter wheat and spring wheat, respectively. This explains the large year effect as a result of variation in growing (May-August) season precipitation. The non-significant tillage system by year interaction implies that the positive benefits of ZT and MT occur over a wide range of growing conditions, while the absence of a tillage system by crop sequence interaction suggests that knowledge developed under CT management also applies to ZT and MT. The results of this study support the large shifts towards in conservation tillage being observed in the Canadian prairies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conservation tillage preserves soil water and this has been the main reason for its rapid dissemination in rainfed agriculture in semiarid climates. We determined the effects of conservation versus conventional tillage on available soil water capacity (AWC) and related properties at the end of 5 years of management on a clay loam calcic soil (Calcic Haploxerept) in semiarid northern Spain. No-tillage with (NTSB) and without stubble burning (NT), reduced chisel-plough tillage (RT) and conventional tillage with mouldboard plough (MT) were compared in rainfed barley monoculture. Bulk density (rho(b)), organic matter content (OM), soil water retention (SWR) at matric potentials of 0 to -1500 kPa, and soil water content (SWC) were determined in the driest year of the 5-year study period. Soil OM in the upper 0.15 m was significantly higher (13%) under NTSB, NT and RT than under MT. Soil rho(b) in the upper 0.15 m under NT and NTSB was greater than under RT and MT, but at a depth of 0.15-0.30 m was greater under RT than under the other treatments. Reorganisation of pore sizes due to tillage treatments affected AWC. Under RT and MT the largest percentage of the total soil porosity was occupied by pores > 9 mu m (equivalent pore diameter), in accordance with lower Job. Available water capacity was greater with NT than with RT and MT. Higher SWC under conservation tillage systems (NT, NTSB and RT) than under MT was attributed mainly to greater AWC and to the mulching effect of crop residues. Crop yield in the driest year of the 5-year period was lowest under MT whereas no differences among treatments were found over the 5-year period. Stubble burning did not affect AWC nor barley yield. Tillage had a greater impact on soil properties and on crop yield than crop residue management. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil management practices are needed in the subarctic that stabilize the soil against the forces of wind and water as well as conserve soil water for crop production. There is a paucity of information, however, regarding the long-term effects of conservation tillage on soil hydraulic properties in subarctic Alaska. The objective of this study was therefore to characterize infiltration, water retention, and saturated hydraulic conductivity of a soil 20 years after establishing tillage and straw management treatments in interior Alaska. The strip plot experimental design, established on a silt loam and maintained in continuous barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), included tillage as the main treatment and straw management as the secondary treatment. Tillage treatments included no tillage, autumn chisel plow, spring disk, and intensive tillage (autumn and spring disk) while straw treatments included retaining or removing stubble and loose straw from the soil surface after harvest. Soil properties were measured after sowing in spring 2004; saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured by the falling-head method, infiltration was measured using a double-ring infiltrometer, and water retention was assessed by measuring the temporal variation in in-situ soil water content. No tillage resulted in greater saturated hydraulic conductivity and generally retained more water against gravitational and matric forces than other tillage treatments. Infiltration was greater in autumn chisel plow than other tillage treatments and was presumably suppressed in no tillage by an organic layer overlying mineral soil. Infiltration was also enhanced by retaining straw on rather than removing straw from the soil surface after harvest. No tillage is not yet a sustainable management practice in this region due to lack of weed control strategies. In addition, the formation of an organic layer in no tillage has important ramifications for the soil hydrological and thermal environment. Therefore, minimum tillage (i.e., autumn chisel plow or spring disk) appears to be a viable management option for maximizing infiltration in interior Alaska. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Normally sown in March in the region of Meknes (Morocco), rainfed sunflower suffers from a severe water deficit from anthesis which seriously affects grain filling. Increasing the stored soil water by appropriate management during the long period of bare soil preceding sunflower planting could be an opportunity which has not been explored for this spring-sown crop. Five methods for autumn soil tillage (mouldboard ploughing, chiselling, paraploughing, disc harrowing, no tillage) and four fallowing methods (chemical weed control, mechanical weeding, allowing weeds and volunteer crops, sowing barley) were compared in Meknes between 1994 and 1998 on calcimagnesic soils with vertic behaviour. Two additional experiments were carried out in 1997 and 1998 to create a range of leaf area indexes and transpiration requirements for sunflower. This was obtained (i) in 1997, by four levels of plant density (2.5-10.0 plants/m(2)) and three levels of soil water at planting (89, 37, and 29% of total available soil water); (ii) in 1998, by six levels of sunflower defoliation at star bud stage. Simulations with the EPIC-Phase model were performed to explore a wider range of weather conditions (1960-1998) than experienced. The differences in water storage at planting were explained partly by the mode of action of each of the implements tested and partly by the weather conditions which prevailed during the fallow period. After a very dry fallow period (with a frequency less than 1 year in 10), water storage was maximal after disc harrowing and paraploughing (including straw mulching) because soil layers were only marginally exposed to evaporation. Conversely, in a year with a wet fallow period (with a frequency of 4 years in 10), mouldboard and chisel ploughing gave the largest water reserves at planting because of better infiltration at depth with increased porosity. When the fallow period was initially wet, but dry in early spring (with a frequency of 2 years in 10), minimum and no tillage gave the best water Storage but the differences between tillage methods were small. In spite of differences in soil water content at planting and clear differences in rooting systems, sunflower yield and seasonal water use were not significantly affected by soil tillage provided that the plant population was the same and weed control was adequate in reduced tillage systems. However, chisel ploughing was a good compromise for maximising stored water at sunflower planting on the clay soils of Meknes. Surprisingly, maximizing soil water content at sunflower planting was not systematically the best solution for maximizing sunflower yield and water use efficiency under the semi-arid conditions of Meknes. A high soil water content at planting leads to excessive leaf area index at the bud stage and consequently to rapid water depletion and yield reduction, especially when seasonal precipitation is low. A 50% refilling of the soil water reserve is sufficient for spring-sown sunflower as was confirmed by the simulation study. Soil moisture in the uppermost layer which governs seedling establishment is a more limiting factor for sunflower yield than total soil water content at planting. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Opinions differ on the necessity of deep tillage for sustaining crop productivity in the rainfed Vertisols of the semi-arid tropics of central India. We conducted a field experiment for 3 years (2000-2002) with a factorial combination of three cropping systems (sole soybean, sole pigeonpea and soybean/pigeonpea intercropping in 2:1 row ratio) and three tillage practices (conventional, conventional + subsoiling in alternate years and conventional + subsoiling every year). Objectives were (i) to examine the effect of subsoiling Vertisols on sustaining yield of soybean/pigeon pea intercropping, and (ii) to assess the frequency of subsoiling for realizing maximum yield and profit. Though there was a reduction in growth and yield of intercrops, higher soybean equivalent yield (SEY) and area-time equivalent ratio (ATER) value in soybean/ pigeonpea intercropping system as compared to sole soybean had a yield advantage. The average yield advantage in intercropping system was 60% higher than that from sole soybean. The yield advantage of intercropping system in terms of ATER was 7% greater with subsoiling than conventional tillage. The yield response to subsoiling was consistent over the period and on an average, subsoiling increased yield by 20%. The effect was associated with improved water storage and root length density. However, with respect to energy use efficiency and profit, the effect of subsoiling was comparable to conventional tillage. The variation in net return and benefit:cost ratio in subsoiling every year and subsoiling in alternate years in sole soybean and soybean/pigeonpea intercropping was not significant. However, in sole pigeon pea subsoiling every year out-yielded subsoiling in alternate years. The interactive effect of subsoiling and intercropping increased the yield by 21-25%. Thus, under tainted cropping where drought of unpredictable intensity and duration is a prevailing feature, soybean/pigeon pea intercropping could be a promising option, especially when combined with subsoiling in alternate years.
