AB Low and extremely variable precipitations limit dryland crop production in the semi-arid areas of Aragon (NE Spain). These areas are also affected by high annual rates of topsoil losses by both wind and water erosion. A long-term experiment to determine the feasibility of conservation tillage in the main winter barley production areas of Aragon was initiated in 1989 at four locations, three on loam to silt loam soils (Xerollic Calciorthid) and one on a silty clay loam (Fluventic Ustochrept), receiving between 300 and 600 mm of average annual rainfall. In this study, we compared, under both continuous cropping and cereal-fallow rotation, the effects of conventional tillage (mouldboard plough) and two conservation tillage systems, reduced tillage (chisel plough) and no-tillage, on soil water content and penetration resistance during the first two growing seasons. Whereas reduced and conventionally tilled treatments generally had similar soil water content during the experimental period, the effects of no-tillage were inconsistent. No-tilled plots had from 26% less to 17% more stored soil water (0-80 cm) than conventional tilled plots at the beginning of the growing season. In contrast to the conventional and reduced tillage treatments, penetration resistances were between 2 and 4 MPa after sowing in most of the plough layer (0-40 cm) under no-tillage at all sites. Fallow efficiencies in moisture storage in the cereal-fallow rotation, when compared with the continuous cropping system, ranged from -8.7 to 12%. The highest efficiencies were recorded when the rainfall in the months close to primary tillage exceeded 100 mm. Since this event is very unlikely, long fallowing (9-10 months) appears to be an inefficient practice for water conservation under both conventional and conservation management. Our results suggest that, up to now, only reduced tillage could replace conventional tillage without adverse effects on soil water content and penetration resistance in the dryland cereal-growing areas of Aragon.

AB Conservation tillage systems, which maintain crop residues on the soil surface, are becoming more widely used. Crop residues serve as ground cover to reduce soil erosion and act as a sink-source for plant nutrients. A better understanding of the processes involved in crop residue decomposition and N release in these systems is needed to develop more efficient residue and Fertility management practices. A greenhouse study was conducted to determine N availability to corn (Zea mays L.) from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) residues and intact roots and soil as affected by residue placement. Tracer N-15 was used to quantify the N recovered by corn from wheat residues and intact roots and soil. Wheat residues were either surface-placed or incorporated in a Mexico silt loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Udollic Ochraqualf) in pots with intact wheat roots. Residue placement significantly influenced the amount of N-15 recovered by corn from wheat residues but not from intact roots and soil. Corn N-15 recovery was significantly higher from incorporated residues than from surface residues; however, this was not reflected in the dry weight. Corn dry weight was 12% greater from surface residues than from incorporated residues. Higher yield from surface residues was attributed to a more constant optimum soil water content.
